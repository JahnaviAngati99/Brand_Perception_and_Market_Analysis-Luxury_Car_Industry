# Brand_Perception_and_Market_Analysis-Luxury_Car_Industry

## Project Overview
This project was conducted as a consultancy for JD Power and Associates to analyze the entry-level luxury car market in the USA. Insights were derived from social media conversations, with an emphasis on providing strategic advice to the client.

## Installation
Python packages required include `selenium`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `numpy`, `nltk`, `sklearn`, and `seaborn`. The Selenium WebDriver requires ChromeDriver, which is also included in the setup.

## Data Collection
The data was collected from Edmunds.com's discussion forums using Selenium WebDriver. A custom scraper was written to navigate through the forum pages and extract relevant post data. The posts were chosen from either the oldest or the newest, due to forum structure changes on Edmunds.com.

## Methodology
The project consisted of several analytical tasks:

- **Task A**: Zipf's law econometric testing and plotting of word frequencies.
- **Task B**: Frequency count of top car brands and mapping of car models to brands.
- **Task C**: Lift ratio calculations for brand associations.
- **Task D**: Brand visualization using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS).
- **Task E-F**: Insights and advice to the client based on the analyses.

## Results
Results include the top car brands, associated attributes, and strategic insights for the client. These results are compiled in the attached Jupyter notebook, which contains detailed code and visualizations.
